About me:

I am a postbac student at UC Santa Cruz studying the evolution of radio-quiet neutron star - light black hole binary systems. Before coming to Santa Cruz, I was an undergraduate student at the University of Colima in Mexico, where I obtained my BSc. in Physics.

Besides physics and astronomy, I love to play classical guitar and to go swimming. As a twelve-year old boy, I attended a boarding school where I accidentally discovered my passion for guitar and soon after graduating I enrolled in a music conservatory as a part-time student to study classical guitar. Over a decade ago, I also used to participate in swimming competitions at a regional level, but now I mostly swim to keep my body healthy and to have fun.










Squeezed-coherent


Coherent states and squeezed states were introduced in the 1920s by Schrödinger and Kennard, respectively. But it was until 1985 when squeezed states of light were ultimately observed by Slusher and collaborators. Today, squeezed states are widely used within quantum sensing and routinely improve the sensitivity of a range of different sensors, including LIGO. Squeezed-coherent states are the most general ones, and they are created by applying the squeezing operator onto the ground state of the simple quantum harmonic oscillator, followed by applying the displacement operator. These states are increasingly becoming important across different subfields in physics and have been used in recent experiments as a way to improve stimulated emission microscopy for biological systems, and as a way to measure the small changes induced by axions in resonant-microwave-cavity-based searches for dark matter. Hence, my collaborators and I expect an increased interest in working with these states. In our work, we showed three different ways to construct the wavefunction for squeezed-coherent states: (i) a differential equation-based approach; (ii) an approach that uses an expansion in terms of the simple-harmonic oscillator wavefunctions; and (iii) a fully operator-based approach.

Community


In the summer of 2020, I participated in a hackathon-style online competition organized by the Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings where my team and I created a webinar platform to make research seminars more accesible to people around the world. This was an interdisciplinary project that was completed by a group of seven young scientists from seven countries working in different fields of science, such as economics, chemistry, and physics. 
Shortly after that, we discovered that another group of senior mathematicians had just started a similar project called <a href="https://researchseminars.org/acknowledgments" target="_blank">researchseminars.org</a>, and we decided to partner with them to work towards the same goal.
